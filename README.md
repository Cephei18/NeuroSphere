# 🌍 **NeuroSphere: Bridging Awareness for Neurodiversity**

## 📌 **Overview**
In many parts of the world, particularly in India, neurodiversity is often misunderstood. Parents and educators may struggle to recognize conditions such as Autism, ADHD, and Dyslexia, leading to a lack of support and unnecessary pressure on neurodiverse individuals. 

**NeuroSphere** is a groundbreaking initiative designed to foster understanding and empathy through an **immersive AR-driven experience**. By allowing users to step into the shoes of neurodiverse individuals, we aim to create a world where neurodiversity is not just acknowledged but embraced.
